## Project Overview
In this project, we explore how laptop prices vary based on different factors. The goal is to help users quickly spot trends and understand what influences laptop costs. 

- **Laptop Type**: Different types like Gaming laptops, Workstations, and Netbooks come with different price tags. Gaming laptops and Workstations are more expensive, while Netbooks tend to be cheaper.
- **Brand**: Brand matters too. High-end brands like **Razer** have higher prices, while others like **Mediacom** are more affordable. This helps users see if paying extra for a brand is worth it.
- **Specifications**: We also look at how the specs like **RAM**, **CPU speed**, and **screen size**—affect prices. You can see how better specs usually mean higher prices.
- **Operating System**: Most laptops run **Windows 10**, but we also show the price differences for other systems like macOS or Linux.

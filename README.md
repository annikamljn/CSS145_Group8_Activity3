- **Type of Laptop**: Differences in average prices between categories like Gaming, Workstations, and Netbooks.
- **Brand Influence**: Examining the price trends by manufacturer, comparing brands like Razer, LG, and Mediacom.
- **Technical Specifications**: The impact of CPU frequency, RAM size, GPU type, and screen resolution on laptop prices.

## Visualizations
This dashboard offers the following visualizations:
1. **Bar Chart**: Average price by laptop type.
2. **Pie Chart**: Distribution of operating systems.
3. **Box Plot**: Laptop weight by type.
4. **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix of technical specifications and price.
5. **Scatter Plot**: Price vs. RAM size.
6. **Network Graph**: Connections between brands and price ranges.

## Key Insights:
- **Workstations** and **Gaming laptops** are the most expensive, with **Netbooks** being the cheapest.
- **Razer** laptops tend to be the most expensive, with an average price of over €3000.
- **Windows 10** dominates the market with over 80% of laptops running this OS.
- Higher **RAM** capacities and **CPU frequencies** generally correspond to higher prices.

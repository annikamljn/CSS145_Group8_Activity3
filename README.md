## Tools & Libraries:
- **Streamlit** for creating the interactive web app
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualizations
- **Pandas** for handling and analyzing data
- **Altair** and **Plotly** for generating interactive charts
- **NetworkX** for network-based visualizations

## Dataset
The dataset focuses on laptop prices and includes features such as `TypeName`, `Price (Euro)`, `RAM`, `Operating System`, and more. It offers insights into how various factors impact laptop pricing.

## Project Overview
We analyzed several factors that influence laptop prices, including:
- **Laptop Type**: How prices vary across categories like Gaming laptops, Workstations, and Netbooks.
- **Brand**: Price trends based on manufacturers like Razer, LG, and Mediacom.
- **Technical Specs**: The role of CPU frequency, RAM size, GPU type, and screen resolution in determining prices.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are featured in the dashboard:
1. **Bar Chart**: Average price by laptop type
2. **Pie Chart**: Operating system distribution
3. **Box Plot**: Laptop weight categorized by type
4. **Heatmap**: Correlations between specs and prices
5. **Scatter Plot**: Price versus RAM size
6. **Network Graph**: Connections between brands and price ranges

## Key Insights:
- **Workstations** and **Gaming laptops** are the priciest, while **Netbooks** are the most affordable.
- **Razer** laptops have the highest average price, exceeding €3000.
- **Windows 10** is the most common OS, installed on over 80% of laptops in the dataset.
- Higher **RAM** capacities and **CPU frequencies** generally result in higher prices.
